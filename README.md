# HeimdallRF
HeimdallRF is an open-source, pocket-sized drone detector built on ESP32. It passively scans 868/915 MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz bands to detect FPV, RC links and analog video signals. Designed for hackers, makers and researchers, HeimdallRF offers an OLED UI, buzzer alerts and USB logging â€“ no jamming, passive only.
