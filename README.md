# HeimdallRF

**HeimdallRF** is a pocket-sized, open-source drone detector built on the ESP32.  
Inspired by the mythological guardian who could hear grass grow and see snow fall, HeimdallRF watches the airwaves for you.

---

## ✨ Vision
Consumer drones, FPV rigs and RC links are everywhere.  
HeimdallRF is designed as a **DIY, hacker-friendly tool** to passively detect activity in popular frequency bands used by drones and FPV systems – so you always know when the sky above you is not quiet.

---

## 🚀 Features (Planned v1.0)
- **Multi-band RF detection**
  - 868/915 MHz (LoRa, Crossfire, LRS)  
  - 2.4 GHz (ELRS, FrSky, Wi-Fi FPV)  
  - 5.8 GHz (Analog FPV video)  
- **Passive only** – no jamming, no interference  
- **OLED interface** with signal bars, event log, and alerts  
- **Audio feedback** (buzzer / Geiger-counter style)  
- **USB-CDC logging** for advanced users  
- **Open source firmware** (ESP-IDF / Arduino compatible)  

---

## 🛠️ Roadmap
- **v0.1** – Breadboard prototype, RSSI scanning, serial logs  
- **v0.2** – Custom PCB, OLED UI, Li-ion battery pack  
- **v0.3** – Remote ID (BLE / Wi-Fi) parser  
- **v1.0** – First crowdfunding batch (Indiegogo), 3D-printed case, polished firmware  

Future expansions (stretch goals):  
- Acoustic add-on module (Shahed / loitering munition detection)  
- Huginn/Muninn expansion boards (extra sensors, modularity)  
- Mesh networking for distributed monitoring
